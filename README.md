## Features

- **Drag and Drop Functionality**: Users can drag and drop blocks from the toolbox into the scripting area.
- **Motion and Looks Blocks**: Implemented blocks for basic motion and appearance changes.
- **Execute Scripts**: Users can run the scripts they create.
- **Replay Actions**: Users can replay the history of actions performed on the sprite.

## Technologies Used
